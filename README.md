Kyuukedex
=========

The (soon) ultimate SPA Pokedex.

Features
--------

*   An infinite-scroll, lazy-loading complete Pokedex.
*   A per-Pokemon detail page where you can (currently) check their:
    *   Default picture, body data, typing, stats and evolution family;
    *   High final stat product using EV - IV - Level - Natures sliders;
    *   Complete moveset (name, power, type...) sort by game & method!
    *   Evolution chain with triggers, conditions with a tree-like visual;
    *   Abilities (hidden ones are marked with a \*);
    *   Alternate forms & varieties with clickable links!;
*   A (Moon/Sun stone)-inspired dark & light theme!
*   French & English localization (~80% of content)

Known bugs
----------

Honestly, a sh\*t ton

*   Abilities translations are not immediate.
    * Workaround: click on another ability & go back (or refresh the page).
*   All evolution triggers are yet to be all implemented.
*   ???
