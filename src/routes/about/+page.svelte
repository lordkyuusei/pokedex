<h1>Yet another Pokedex on the Internet</h1>
<small>I know. I know!</small>

<p>
	When I want to learn a new language, a new framework, a new pattern, I don't like to read
	documentations. I prefer to download the usual sample/skeleton/demo app and screw it until it
	doesn't work anymore.
</p>

<p>
	This time, I wanted to make something out of it because <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a> is
	an amazing language. It looks like Vue.js, which I already love & use, but still different.
</p>

<strong>So why not make a f*cking whole pokedex out of it?</strong>

<p>Several pros:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>POKE</strong> means pocket: it must be handy, super easy to use.</li>
	<li>
		<strong>DEX</strong> means codex: it must displays a sh*it ton of data, on the smallest area possible.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>ALOHA</strong> means family: it should be as cozy and welcoming as a family movie party night!
	</li>
</ul>

Thanks you for using this app!
